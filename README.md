# OpenAIClass

This repository contains Python code examples and exercises implemented during the **OpenAI API training session by Programming Pathshala**.  
The goal of this project was to learn how to integrate and use **OpenAI's GPT models** for various tasks such as text generation, question answering, and custom prompt-based outputs.

## ‚úÖ Description  
During the training, I explored how to work with **OpenAI API** in Python using the `openai` package. The exercises include:

- Printing simple outputs in Python
- Using **OpenAI Chat Completions API** with `gpt-4.1` model
- Creating structured prompts for:
  - Answering user queries
  - Acting like a calculator
  - Generating country capitals based on input
  - Providing responses like a search engine snippet

This project demonstrates **prompt engineering**, **temperature control**, and **response parsing** with the OpenAI API.
